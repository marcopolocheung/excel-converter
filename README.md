# Toast Excel --> Bookkeeping Excel final.

Low-level deployment of Excel converter for non-technical @ China Rose. Solves issue of automating bookkeeping for lower-end computers across multiple business locations by deploying a website all locations can use at the same time.

This is a lightweight website deployment of the Excel converter tool used by non-technical staff at ChinaRose.

The tool streamlines bookkeeping across multiple business locations by enabling users to compile 3 Excel files into 1 through a simple upload-download interface.

The converter is deployed via GitHub Pages to ensure accessibility from any location with an internet connection. This setup is optimized for lower-end computers and avoids reliance on local software installations so user error is minimized.


Notes:

Front-end needs work, looks terrible
